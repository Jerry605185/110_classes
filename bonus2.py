Worth 2 stars

Using a similar idea as bonus 1 (objects of the same class being set to attributes of the class) create a class for a Binary Tree (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/)
The class needs to have an initialization that can take an unsorted array and turn it into a tree, as well as methods that can do the following:

1. Add an element to the tree
2. Delete an element from the tree by value
3. balance the tree (equalize the size of the left and right sizes as much as possible)
4. Give a sorted list of the elements

All implementation details and testing are left up to you
