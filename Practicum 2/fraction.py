Here we will define a new class, Fraction, which will allow us to do fractional opertions. 
The class will have 2 attributes: ints Numerator, num, and Denominator, denom. 
When printed, the following should print "num / denom". 
The class must also have a function, simplify, which will simplify the numerator and denominator to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the ratio.
Multiplication, Division, addition and subtraction all need to be overidden and should all return a simplified fraction.
These algebraic opertions must take as an input either another Fraction Object or an Int and should handle them appropriately

If any of the algrebraic operations can't be done because of the types your code should output "operation could not be completed because of
input types" rather than crashing (your code should continue to run) -- you should do this with a Try/Catch

Please write your own tests to make sure your class works correctly.
