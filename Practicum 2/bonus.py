Create a new class, basedInt, which inherit all behavior from the int class, except that all algebraic operations can be done between ints with different bases
i.e. we operate in base 10 (10 = 10), but 5 in base 2 (10 = 2) would be 101. The algebraic operations should take inputs of either basedInts or Ints. 
If you are unfarmiliar with bases please look for resources online: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/bases.html

The print should also state the base of the basedInt like so "10b2" == 11 in base 2 (3 in base 10)
